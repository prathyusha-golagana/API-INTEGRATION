## Project Overview

The **Enhanced Weather App** is a simple yet powerful web-based application that enables users to get real-time weather information for any city in the world. 
Built using vanilla HTML, Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript for logic, this project leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display accurate weather data in a clean and user-friendly interface.

This project is ideal for beginners learning how to work with APIs, build responsive UIs with Bootstrap, and handle JavaScript DOM events and fetch requests. It can also serve as a base project for more advanced features like 5-day forecasts, local storage of past searches, or geolocation support.
