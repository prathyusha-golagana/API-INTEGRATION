*DESCRIPTION* :


## 📌 Project Overview

The Enhanced Weather App is a lightweight, responsive, and dynamic web application that allows users to retrieve and view real-time weather information for any city in the world. This project is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and Bootstrap, making it a great example of how simple technologies can be combined to create a modern, interactive web experience.

The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data including temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and wind speed. Users can simply enter a city name in the input field and view the current weather conditions instantly, including icons representing the weather type (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).

This project is particularly suited for beginners who are learning the basics of API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch), DOM manipulation, and responsive web design. Additionally, it offers a great foundation for further enhancements such as location-based search, 5-day forecasts, storing past searches, and implementing offline caching.

## 🚀 Features

🔍 Search by City Name

Users can type the name of any city into the search bar to retrieve real-time weather data using OpenWeatherMap's RESTful API.

📡 Live API Integration

Weather data is fetched in real time using a fetch call to the OpenWeatherMap API. The data includes temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a descriptive weather icon.

🌡️ Detailed Weather Display

The app displays:

The name of the selected city.

Weather description (e.g., light rain, clear sky) along with a visual icon.

Current temperature and what it "feels like".

Humidity percentage.

Wind speed in meters per second.

🛡️ Error Handling

If the user enters an invalid or non-existent city name, the app gracefully displays an error message instead of crashing or remaining blank. This ensures a smoother user experience and clear feedback.

📱 Responsive UI

The user interface is designed using Bootstrap 5, ensuring it looks good and functions properly across different screen sizes including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

💡 Simple and Clean Layout

The layout is minimalist and intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with the app without distractions.
